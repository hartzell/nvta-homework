# Things ToDo(tm)

## Unfinished business

- [ ] figure out issue w/ capturing standard output in
  tests/test_cli/test_main.py, pytest and click seem to be fighting
  over my use of sys.stdout and the csv writer.

## Extensions

- [ ] raise specific exception subclasses
- [ ] validate inputs in Query and TranscriptMapping classes
